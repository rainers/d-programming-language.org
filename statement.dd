	$(P Any ambiguities in the grammar between $(I Statement)s and
	$(GLINK2 declaration, Declaration)s are
	resolved by the declarations taking precedence.
	If a $(I Statement) is desired instead, wrapping it in parentheses will
	disambiguate it in favor of being a $(I Statement).
	)

<h2>$(LNAME2 ScopeStatement, Scope Statements)</h2>

$(GRAMMAR
$(I ScopeStatement):
    $(GLINK NonEmptyStatement)
    $(GLINK BlockStatement)
)

	$(P A new scope for local symbols
	is introduced for the $(I NonEmptyStatement)
	or $(GLINK BlockStatement).
	)

	$(P Even though a new scope is introduced,
	local symbol declarations cannot shadow (hide) other
	local symbol declarations in the same function.
	)

--------------
void func1(int x)
{   int x;	// illegal, x shadows parameter x

    int y;

    { int y; }	// illegal, y shadows enclosing scope's y

    void delegate() dg;
    dg = { int y; };	// ok, this y is not in the same function

    struct S
    {
	int y;		// ok, this y is a member, not a local
    }

    { int z; }
    { int z; }	// ok, this z is not shadowing the other z

    { int t; }
    { t++;   }	// illegal, t is undefined
}
--------------

$(P
	The idea is to avoid bugs in complex functions caused by
	scoped declarations inadvertently hiding previous ones.
	Local names should all be unique within a function.
)


<h2>$(LNAME2 ScopeBlockStatement, Scope Block Statements)</h2>

$(GRAMMAR
$(I ScopeBlockStatement):
    $(GLINK BlockStatement)
)

	$(P A scope block statement introduces a new scope for the
	$(GLINK BlockStatement).
	)

<h2>$(LNAME2 LabeledStatement, Labeled Statements)</h2>

$(P	Statements can be labeled. A label is an identifier that
	precedes a statement.
)

$(GRAMMAR
$(I LabeledStatement):
    $(I Identifier) : $(PSSEMI)
)

$(P
	Any statement can be labeled, including empty statements,
	and so can serve as the target
	of a goto statement. Labeled statements can also serve as the
	target of a break or continue statement.
)
$(P
	Labels are in a name space independent of declarations, variables,
	types, etc.
	Even so, labels cannot have the same name as local declarations.
	The label name space is the body of the function
	they appear in. Label name spaces do not nest, i.e. a label
	inside a block statement is accessible from outside that block.
)

<h2>$(LNAME2 BlockStatement, Block Statement)</h2>

$(GRAMMAR
$(I BlockStatement):
    $(B { })
    $(B {) $(I StatementList) $(B })

$(GNAME StatementList):
    $(PSSEMI_PSCURLYSCOPE)
    $(PSSEMI_PSCURLYSCOPE) $(I StatementList)
)

$(P
	A block statement is a sequence of statements enclosed
	by { }. The statements are executed in lexical order.
)
<h2>$(LNAME2 ExpressionStatement, Expression Statement)</h2>

$(GRAMMAR
$(I ExpressionStatement):
    $(EXPRESSION) $(B ;)
)

	The expression is evaluated.
	<p>

	Expressions that have no effect, like $(TT (x + x)),
	are illegal
	in expression statements.
	If such an expression is needed, casting it to $(D_KEYWORD void) will
	make it legal.

----
int x;
x++;                // ok
x;                  // illegal
1+1;                // illegal
cast(void)(x + x);  // ok
----

<h2>$(LNAME2 DeclarationStatement, Declaration Statement)</h2>

	Declaration statements declare variables and types.

$(GRAMMAR
$(I DeclarationStatement):
    $(I Declaration)
)

	$(P Some declaration statements:)

----
int a;		 // declare a as type int and initialize it to 0
struct S { }	 // declare struct s
alias int myint;
----

<h2>$(LNAME2 IfStatement, If Statement)</h2>

	If statements provide simple conditional execution of statements.

$(GRAMMAR
$(I IfStatement):
	$(B if $(LPAREN)) $(I IfCondition) $(B $(RPAREN)) $(I ThenStatement)
	$(B if $(LPAREN)) $(I IfCondition) $(B $(RPAREN)) $(I ThenStatement) $(B else) $(I ElseStatement)

$(GNAME IfCondition):
	$(EXPRESSION)
	$(B auto) $(I Identifier) $(B =) $(EXPRESSION)
	$(GLINK2 declaration, BasicType) $(GLINK2 declaration, Declarator) $(B =) $(EXPRESSION)

$(GNAME ThenStatement):
	$(PSSCOPE)

$(GNAME ElseStatement):
	$(PSSCOPE)
)

	$(EXPRESSION) is evaluated and must have a type that
	can be converted to a boolean. If it's true the
	$(I ThenStatement) is transferred to, else the $(I ElseStatement)
	is transferred to.
	<p>

	The 'dangling else' parsing problem is solved by associating the
	else with the nearest if statement.
	<p>

	If an $(B auto) $(I Identifier) is provided, it is declared and
	initialized
	to the value
	and type of the $(EXPRESSION). Its scope extends from when it is
	initialized to the end of the $(I ThenStatement).
	<p>

	If a $(I Declarator) is provided, it is declared and
	initialized
	to the value
	of the $(EXPRESSION). Its scope extends from when it is
	initialized to the end of the $(I ThenStatement).

---
import std.regexp;
...
if (auto m = std.regexp.search("abcdef", "b(c)d"))
{
    writefln("[%s]", m.pre);      // prints [a]
    writefln("[%s]", m.post);     // prints [ef]
    writefln("[%s]", m.match(0)); // prints [bcd]
    writefln("[%s]", m.match(1)); // prints [c]
    writefln("[%s]", m.match(2)); // prints []
}
else
{
    writefln(m.post);    // error, m undefined
}
writefln(m.pre);         // error, m undefined
---

<h2>$(LNAME2 WhileStatement, While Statement)</h2>

$(GRAMMAR
$(I WhileStatement):
    $(B while $(LPAREN)) $(EXPRESSION) $(B $(RPAREN)) $(PSSCOPE)
)

	While statements implement simple loops.

	$(EXPRESSION) is evaluated and must have a type that
	can be converted to a boolean. If it's true the
	$(PSSCOPE) is executed. After the $(PSSCOPE) is executed,
	the $(EXPRESSION) is evaluated again, and if true the
	$(PSSCOPE) is executed again. This continues until the
	$(EXPRESSION) evaluates to false.

---
int i = 0;
while (i < 10)
{
    foo(i);
    i++;
}
---

	A $(GLINK BreakStatement) will exit the loop.
	A $(GLINK ContinueStatement)
	will transfer directly to evaluating $(EXPRESSION) again.

<h2>$(LNAME2 DoStatement, Do Statement)</h2>

$(GRAMMAR
$(I DoStatement):
    $(B do) $(PSSCOPE) $(B  while $(LPAREN)) $(EXPRESSION) $(B $(RPAREN))
)

	Do while statements implement simple loops.

	$(PSSCOPE) is executed. Then
	$(EXPRESSION) is evaluated and must have a type that
	can be converted to a boolean. If it's true the
	loop is iterated again.
	This continues until the
	$(EXPRESSION) evaluates to false.

---
int i = 0;
do
{
    foo(i);
} while (++i < 10);
---

	A $(GLINK BreakStatement) will exit the loop.
	A $(GLINK ContinueStatement)
	will transfer directly to evaluating $(EXPRESSION) again.

<h2>$(LNAME2 ForStatement, For Statement)</h2>

	For statements implement loops with initialization,
	test, and increment clauses.

$(GRAMMAR
$(I ForStatement):
	$(B for $(LPAREN))$(I Initialize) $(I Test)$(OPT) $(B ;) $(I Increment)$(OPT)$(B $(RPAREN)) $(PSSCOPE)

$(GNAME Initialize):
	$(B ;)
	$(PS0)

$(GNAME Test):
	$(EXPRESSION)

$(GNAME Increment):
	$(EXPRESSION)
)

	$(P $(I Initialize) is executed.
	$(I Test) is evaluated and must have a type that
	can be converted to a boolean. If it's true the
	statement is executed. After the statement is executed,
	the $(I Increment) is executed.
	Then $(I Test) is evaluated again, and if true the
	statement is executed again. This continues until the
	$(I Test) evaluates to false.
	)

	$(P A $(GLINK BreakStatement) will exit the loop.
	A $(GLINK ContinueStatement)
	will transfer directly to the $(I Increment).
	)

	$(P A $(I ForStatement) creates a new scope.
	If $(I Initialize) declares a variable, that variable's scope
	extends through the end of the for statement. For example:
	)

--------------
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	foo(i);
--------------

	is equivalent to:

--------------
{   int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	foo(i);
}
--------------

	Function bodies cannot be empty:

--------------
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	;	// illegal
--------------

	Use instead:

--------------
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
}
--------------

	The $(I Initialize) may be omitted. $(I Test) may also be
	omitted, and if so, it is treated as if it evaluated to true.

<h2>$(LNAME2 ForeachStatement, Foreach Statement)</h2>

	A foreach statement loops over the contents of an aggregate.

$(GRAMMAR
$(I ForeachStatement):
    $(I Foreach) $(B $(LPAREN))$(I ForeachTypeList) $(B ;) $(I Aggregate)$(B $(RPAREN)) $(PS0)

$(GNAME Foreach):
    $(B foreach)
    $(B foreach_reverse)

$(GNAME ForeachTypeList):
    $(I ForeachType)
    $(I ForeachType) , $(I ForeachTypeList)

$(GNAME ForeachType):
    $(B ref)$(OPT) $(GLINK2 declaration, BasicType) $(GLINK2 declaration, Declarator)
    $(B ref)$(OPT) $(I Identifier)

$(GNAME Aggregate):
    $(EXPRESSION)
)

$(P
	$(I Aggregate) is evaluated. It must evaluate to an expression
	of type static array, dynamic array, associative array,
	struct, class, delegate, or tuple.
	The $(PS0) is executed, once for each element of the
	aggregate.
	At the start of each iteration, the variables declared by
	the $(I ForeachTypeList)
	are set to be a copy of the elements of the aggregate.
	If the variable is $(B ref), it is a reference to the
	contents of that aggregate.
)
$(P
	The aggregate must be loop invariant, meaning that
	elements to the aggregate cannot be added or removed from it
	in the $(PS0).
)

<h3>Foreach over Arrays</h3>

$(P
	If the aggregate is a static or dynamic array, there
	can be one or two variables declared. If one, then the variable
	is said to be the $(I value) set to the elements of the array,
	one by one. The type of the
	variable must match the type of the array contents, except for the
	special cases outlined below.
	If there are
	two variables declared, the first is said to be the $(I index)
	and the second is said to be the $(I value). The $(I index)
	must be of $(B int), $(B uint) or $(B size_t) type,
	it cannot be $(I ref),
	and it is set to be the index of the array element.
)
--------------
char[] a;
...
foreach (int i, char c; a)
{
    writefln("a[%d] = '%c'", i, c);
}
--------------

	$(P For $(B foreach), the
	elements for the array are iterated over starting at index 0
	and continuing to the maximum of the array.
	For $(B foreach_reverse), the array elements are visited in the reverse
	order.
	)

<h3>Foreach over Arrays of Characters</h3>

	$(P If the aggregate expression is a static or dynamic array of
	$(B char)s, $(B wchar)s, or $(B dchar)s, then the $(I Type) of
	the $(I value)
	can be any of $(B char), $(B wchar), or $(B dchar).
	In this manner any UTF array
	can be decoded into any UTF type:
	)

--------------
char[] a = "\xE2\x89\xA0";	// \u2260 encoded as 3 UTF-8 bytes

foreach (dchar c; a)
{
    writefln("a[] = %x", c);	// prints 'a[] = 2260'
}

dchar[] b = "\u2260";

foreach (char c; b)
{
    writef("%x, ", c);	// prints 'e2, 89, a0, '
}
--------------


	$(P Aggregates can be string literals, which can be accessed
	as char, wchar, or dchar arrays:
	)

--------------
void test()
{
    foreach (char c; "ab")
    {
	writefln("'%s'", c);
    }
    foreach (wchar w; "xy")
    {
	writefln("'%s'", w);
    }
}
--------------

	$(P which would print:
	)

$(CONSOLE
'a'
'b'
'x'
'y'
)

<h3>Foreach over Associative Arrays</h3>

	$(P If the aggregate expression is an associative array, there
	can be one or two variables declared. If one, then the variable
	is said to be the $(I value) set to the elements of the array,
	one by one. The type of the
	variable must match the type of the array contents. If there are
	two variables declared, the first is said to be the $(I index)
	and the second is said to be the $(I value). The $(I index)
	must be of the same type as the indexing type of the associative
	array. It cannot be $(I ref),
	and it is set to be the index of the array element.
	The order in which the elements of the array is unspecified
	for $(B foreach). $(B foreach_reverse) for associative arrays
	is illegal.
	)

--------------
double[char[]] a;	// $(I index) type is char[], $(I value) type is double
...
foreach (char[] s, double d; a)
{
    writefln("a['%s'] = %g", s, d);
}
--------------

$(V2
<h3>$(LNAME2 foreach_with_ranges, Foreach over Structs and Classes with Ranges)</h3>

	$(P Iteration over struct and class objects can be done with
	ranges, which means the following properties must be defined:
	)

	$(TABLE2 Foreach Range Properties,
	$(TR $(TH Property) $(TH Purpose ))
	$(TR $(TD $(TT .empty)) $(TD returns true if no more elements))
	$(TR $(TD $(TT .popFront)) $(TD move the left edge of the range right one))
	$(TR $(TD $(TT .popBack)) $(TD move the right edge of the range left one))
	$(TR $(TD $(TT .front)) $(TD return the leftmost element of the range))
	$(TR $(TD $(TT .back)) $(TD return the rightmost element of the range))
	)

	$(P Meaning:)

---
foreach (e; range) { ... }
---

	$(P translates to:)

---
for (auto __r = range; !__r.empty; __r.next)
{   auto e = __r.head;
   ...
}
---

	$(P Similarly:)

---
foreach_reverse (e; range) { ... }
---

	$(P translates to:)

---
for (auto __r = range; !__r.empty; __r.retreat)
{   auto e = __r.toe;
   ...
}
---

	$(P If the foreach range properties do not exist, the $(TT opApply)
	method will be used instead.
	)
)

<h3>Foreach over Structs and Classes with opApply</h3>

	$(P
	If it is a struct or class object, the $(B foreach) is defined by
	the special $(LNAME2 #opApply, $(I opApply)) member function.
	The $(B foreach_reverse) behavior is defined by the special
	$(LNAME2 opApplyReverse, $(I opApplyReverse)) member function.
	These special functions must be defined by the type in order
	to use the corresponding foreach statement.
	The functions have the type:
	)

--------------
int $(B opApply)(int delegate(ref $(I Type) [, ...]) $(I dg));

int $(B opApplyReverse)(int delegate(ref $(I Type) [, ...]) $(I dg));
--------------

	$(P where $(I Type) matches the $(I Type) used in the $(I ForeachType)
	declaration of $(I Identifier). Multiple $(I ForeachType)s
	correspond with multiple $(I Type)'s in the delegate type
	passed to $(B opApply) or $(B opApplyReverse).
	There can be multiple $(B opApply) and $(B opApplyReverse) functions,
	one is selected
	by matching the type of $(I dg) to the $(I ForeachType)s
	of the $(I ForeachStatement).
	The body of the apply
	function iterates over the elements it aggregates, passing them
	each to the $(I dg) function. If the $(I dg) returns 0, then
	apply goes on to the next element.
	If the $(I dg) returns a nonzero value, apply must cease
	iterating and return that value. Otherwise, after done iterating
	across all the elements, apply will return 0.
	)

	$(P For example, consider a class that is a container for two elements:
	)

--------------
class Foo
{
    uint array[2];

    int $(B opApply)(int delegate(ref uint) $(I dg))
    {   int result = 0;

	for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
	{
	    result = $(I dg)(array[i]);
	    if (result)
		break;
	}
	return result;
    }
}
--------------

	An example using this might be:

--------------
void test()
{
    Foo a = new Foo();

    a.array[0] = 73;
    a.array[1] = 82;

    foreach (uint u; a)
    {
	writefln("%d", u);
    }
}
--------------

	which would print:

$(CONSOLE
73
82
)

<h3>Foreach over Delegates</h3>

	$(P If $(I Aggregate) is a delegate, the type signature of
	the delegate is of the same as for $(B opApply). This enables
	many different named looping strategies to coexist in the same
	class or struct.)

<h3>Foreach over Tuples</h3>

$(P
	If the aggregate expression is a tuple, there
	can be one or two variables declared. If one, then the variable
	is said to be the $(I value) set to the elements of the tuple,
	one by one. If the type of the
	variable is given, it must match the type of the tuple contents.
	If it is not given, the type of the variable is set to the type
	of the tuple element, which may change from iteration to iteration.
	If there are
	two variables declared, the first is said to be the $(I index)
	and the second is said to be the $(I value). The $(I index)
	must be of $(B int) or $(B uint) type, it cannot be $(I ref),
	and it is set to be the index of the tuple element.
)

$(P
	If the tuple is a list of types, then the foreach statement
	is executed once for each type, and the value is aliased to that
	type.
)

-----
import std.stdio;
import std.typetuple;	// for TypeTuple

void main()
{
    alias TypeTuple!(int, long, double) TL;

    foreach (T; TL)
    {
	writefln(typeid(T));
    }
}
-----

	$(P Prints:)

$(CONSOLE
int
long
double
)

<h3>Foreach Ref Parameters</h3>

	$(P $(B ref) can be used to update the original elements:
	)

--------------
void test()
{
    static uint[2] a = [7, 8];

    foreach (ref uint u; a)
    {
	u++;
    }
    foreach (uint u; a)
    {
	writefln("%d", u);
    }
}
--------------

	which would print:

$(CONSOLE
8
9
)
	$(P $(B ref) can not be applied to the index values.)

	$(P If not specified, the $(I Type)s in the $(I ForeachType) can be
	inferred from
	the type of the $(I Aggregate).
	)

<h3>Foreach Restrictions</h3>

	$(P The aggregate itself must not be resized, reallocated, free'd,
	reassigned or destructed
	while the foreach is iterating over the elements.
	)

--------------
int[] a;
int[] b;
foreach (int i; a)
{
    a = null;			// error
    a.length = a.length + 10;	// error
    a = b;			// error
}
a = null;			// ok
--------------

<h3>Break and Continue out of Foreach</h3>


	$(P A $(GLINK BreakStatement) in the body of the foreach will exit the
	foreach, a $(GLINK ContinueStatement) will immediately start the
	next iteration.
	)

<h2>$(LNAME2 SwitchStatement, Switch Statement)</h2>

	A switch statement goes to one of a collection of case

	$(P If none of the case expressions match, and there is not a default
	statement, a
	$(LINK2 phobos/std_switcherr.html, $(CODE std.switcherr.SwitchError))
	is thrown.
	The reason for this is
	to catch the common programming error of adding a new value to
	an enum, but failing to account for the extra value in

<h2>$(LNAME2 ReturnStatement, Return Statement)</h2>

$(GRAMMAR
$(I ReturnStatement):
    $(B return) $(EXPRESSION)$(OPT) $(B ;)

	A return exits the current function and supplies its return
	value.

	$(EXPRESSION) is required if the function specifies
	a return type that is not void.
	The $(EXPRESSION) is implicitly converted to the
	function return type.
	<p>

	At least one return statement, throw statement, or assert(0) expression
	is required if the function specifies a return type that is not void,
	unless the function contains inline assembler code.
	<p>

	$(EXPRESSION) is allowed even if the function specifies
	a $(D_KEYWORD void) return type. The $(EXPRESSION) will be evaluated,
	but nothing will be returned.
	If the $(EXPRESSION) has no side effects, and the return
	type is $(D_KEYWORD void), then it is illegal.
	<p>

	Before the function actually returns,
	any objects with scope storage duration are destroyed,
	any enclosing finally clauses are executed,
	any scope(exit) statements are executed,
	any scope(success) statements are executed,
	and any enclosing synchronization
	objects are released.
	<p>

	The function will not return if any enclosing finally clause
	does a return, goto or throw that exits the finally clause.
	<p>

	If there is an out postcondition
	(see $(LINK2 dbc.html, Contract Programming)),
	that postcondition is executed
	after the $(EXPRESSION) is evaluated and before the function
	actually returns.

	goto L1;
    x = 3;
L1:
    x++;
---

	The second form, $(CODE goto default;), transfers to the
	innermost $(GLINK DefaultStatement) of an enclosing
	$(GLINK SwitchStatement).
	<p>

	The third form, $(CODE goto case;), transfers to the

	$(I SwitchStatement).
	<p>

	The fourth form, $(CODE goto case $(EXPRESSION);), transfers to the

<h2>$(LNAME2 WithStatement, With Statement)</h2>

	The with statement is a way to simplify repeated references
	to the same object.

$(GRAMMAR
$(I WithStatement):
	$(B with) $(B $(LPAREN)) $(EXPRESSION) $(B $(RPAREN)) $(PSSCOPE)
	$(B with) $(B $(LPAREN)) $(LINK2 template.html#Symbol, $(I Symbol)) $(B $(RPAREN)) $(PSSCOPE)
	$(B with) $(B $(LPAREN)) $(LINK2 template.html#TemplateInstance, $(I TemplateInstance)) $(B $(RPAREN)) $(PSSCOPE)
)

	where $(EXPRESSION) evaluates to a class reference or struct
	instance.
	Within the with body the referenced object is searched first for
	identifier symbols. The $(I WithStatement)

--------------
$(B with) (expression)
{
    ...
    ident;
}
--------------

	is semantically equivalent to:

--------------
{
    Object tmp;
    tmp = expression;
    ...
    tmp.ident;
}
--------------

	$(P Note that $(EXPRESSION) only gets evaluated once.
	The with statement does not change what $(B this) or
	$(B super) refer to.
	)

	$(P For $(I Symbol) which is a scope or $(I TemplateInstance),
	the corresponding scope is searched when looking up symbols.
	For example:
	)

--------------
struct Foo
{
    alias int Y;
}
...
Y y;		// error, Y undefined
with (Foo)
{
    Y y;	// same as Foo.Y y;
}
--------------

$(V2
	$(P Use of with object symbols that shadow local symbols with
	the same identifier are not allowed.
	This is to reduce the risk of inadvertant breakage of with
	statements when new members are added to the object declaration.
	)
---
struct S
{
    float x;
}

void main()
{
    int x;
    S s;
    with (s)
    {
        x++;  // error, shadows the int x declaration
    }
}
---
)

<h2>$(LNAME2 SynchronizedStatement, Synchronized Statement)</h2>

	$(P The synchronized statement wraps a statement with
	a mutex to synchronize access among multiple threads.
	)

$(GRAMMAR
$(I SynchronizedStatement):
    $(B synchronized) $(PSSCOPE)
    $(B synchronized $(LPAREN)) $(EXPRESSION) $(B $(RPAREN)) $(PSSCOPE)
)

	$(P Synchronized allows only one thread at a time to execute
	$(I ScopeStatement) by using a mutex.
	)

	$(P What mutex is used is determined by the $(EXPRESSION).
	If there is no $(EXPRESSION), then a global mutex is created,
	one per such synchronized statement.
	Different synchronized statements will have different global mutexes.
	)

	$(P If there is an $(EXPRESSION), it must evaluate to either an
	Object or an instance of an $(I Interface), in which case it
	is cast to the Object instance that implemented that $(I Interface).
	The mutex used is specific to that Object instance, and
	is shared by all synchronized statements referring to that instance.
	)

	$(P The synchronization gets released even if $(I ScopeStatement)
	terminates with an exception, goto, or return.
	)

	$(P Example:
	)

--------------
synchronized { ... }
--------------

	$(P This implements a standard critical section.
	)

<h2>$(LNAME2 TryStatement, Try Statement)</h2>

	Exception handling is done with the try-catch-finally statement.

$(GRAMMAR
$(I TryStatement):
	$(B try) $(PSSCOPE) $(I Catches)
	$(B try) $(PSSCOPE) $(I Catches) $(I FinallyStatement)
	$(B try) $(PSSCOPE) $(I FinallyStatement)

	$(B catch) $(PS0)

$(GNAME Catch):
	$(B catch $(LPAREN)) $(I CatchParameter) $(B $(RPAREN)) $(PS0)

$(GNAME CatchParameter):
	$(GLINK2 declaration, BasicType) $(I Identifier)

$(GNAME FinallyStatement):
	$(B finally) $(PS0)
)

	$(P $(I CatchParameter) declares a variable v of type T, where T is
	$(V1 Object or derived from Object.)
	$(V2 Throwable or derived from Throwable.)
	v is initialized by the throw expression if T is of the same type or a
	base class of the throw expression. The catch clause will be executed
	if the exception object is of type T or derived from T.
	)

	$(P If just type T is given and no variable v, then the catch clause
	is still executed.
	)

	$(P It is an error if any $(I CatchParameter) type T1 hides
	a subsequent $(I Catch) with type T2, i.e. it is an error if
	T1 is the same type as or a base class of T2.
	)

	$(P $(I LastCatch) catches all exceptions.
	)

	$(P The $(I FinallyStatement) is always executed, whether
	the $(B try) $(I ScopeStatement) exits with a goto, break,
	continue, return, exception, or fall-through.
	)
$(V1
	$(P If an exception is raised in the $(I FinallyStatement) and
	is not caught before the $(I FinallyStatement) is executed,
	the new exception replaces any existing exception:
	)
)
$(V2
	$(P If an exception is raised in the $(I FinallyStatement) and is not
	caught before the original exception is caught, it is chained to the
	previous exception via the $(I next) member of $(I Throwable).
	Note that, in contrast to most other programming languages, the new
	exception does not replace the original exception. Instead, later
	exceptions are regarded as 'collateral damage' caused by the first
	exception. The original exception must be caught, and this results in
	the capture of the entire chain.
	)

	$(P Thrown objects derived from $(I Error) are treated differently. They
	bypass the normal chaining mechanism, such that the chain can only be
	caught by catching the first $(I Error). In addition to the list of
	subsequent exceptions, $(I Error) also contains a pointer that points
	to the original	exception (the head of the chain) if a bypass occurred,
	so that the entire exception history is retained.

<h2>$(LNAME2 ScopeGuardStatement, Scope Guard Statement)</h2>

$(GRAMMAR
$(I ScopeGuardStatement):
	$(B scope(exit)) $(PSCURLYSCOPE)
	$(B scope(success)) $(PSCURLYSCOPE)
	$(B scope(failure)) $(PSCURLYSCOPE)
)

	The $(I ScopeGuardStatement) executes $(PSCURLYSCOPE) at the close
	of the current scope, rather than at the point where the
	$(I ScopeGuardStatement) appears.
	$(B scope(exit)) executes $(PSCURLYSCOPE) when the scope
	exits normally or when it exits due to exception unwinding.
	$(B scope(failure)) executes $(PSCURLYSCOPE) when the scope
	exits due to exception unwinding.
	$(B scope(success)) executes $(PSCURLYSCOPE) when the scope
	exits normally.
	<p>

	If there are multiple $(I ScopeGuardStatement)s in a scope, they

<h2>$(LNAME2 VolatileStatement, Volatile Statement)</h2>

	No code motion occurs across volatile statement boundaries.

$(GRAMMAR

	$(B volatile) $(B ;)
)

	$(PSSEMI_PSCURLYSCOPE) is evaluated.
	Memory writes occurring before the $(PSSEMI_PSCURLYSCOPE) are
	performed before any reads within or after the $(PSSEMI_PSCURLYSCOPE).
	Memory reads occurring after the $(PSSEMI_PSCURLYSCOPE) occur after
	any writes before or within $(PSSEMI_PSCURLYSCOPE) are completed.
	<p>

	A volatile statement does not guarantee atomicity. For that,
	use synchronized statements.
)

<h2>$(LNAME2 asm, Asm Statement)</h2>

	Inline assembler is supported with the asm statement:

$(GRAMMAR
$(GNAME AsmStatement):
	$(B asm { })
	$(B asm {) $(I AsmInstructionList) $(B })

$(GNAME AsmInstructionList):
	$(I AsmInstruction) $(B ;)
	$(I AsmInstruction) $(B ;) $(I AsmInstructionList)
)

	An asm statement enables the direct use of assembly language
	instructions. This makes it easy to obtain direct access to special
	CPU features without resorting to an external assembler. The
	D compiler will take care of the function calling conventions,
	stack setup, etc.
	<p>

	The format of the instructions is, of course, highly dependent
	on the native instruction set of the target CPU, and so is
	$(LINK2 iasm.html, implementation defined).
	But, the format will follow the following
	conventions:

	$(UL 
	$(LI It must use the same tokens as the D language uses.)
	$(LI The comment form must match the D language comments.)
	$(LI Asm instructions are terminated by a ;, not by an
	end of line.)
	)

	These rules exist to ensure that D source code can be tokenized
	independently of syntactic or semantic analysis.
	<p>

	For example, for the Intel Pentium:

--------------
int x = 3;
asm
{
    mov	EAX,x;		// load x and put it in register EAX
}
--------------

	Inline assembler can be used to access hardware directly:

--------------
int gethardware()
{
    asm
    {
	    mov	EAX, dword ptr 0x1234;
    }
}
--------------

	For some D implementations, such as a translator from D to C, an
	inline assembler makes no sense, and need not be implemented.
	The version statement can be used to account for this:

--------------
version (D_InlineAsm_X86)
{
    asm
    {
	...
    }
}
else
{
    /* ... some workaround ... */
}
--------------

	$(P Semantically consecutive $(I AsmStatement)s shall not have
	any other instructions (such as register save or restores) inserted
	between them by the compiler.
